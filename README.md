# CMPS-121-Mobile-Applications
Container for CMPS 121 (mostly project) <br>
This project is just a tool to learn some of the basics
of Android mobile development <br>

## Things that could be done after final class submission
1) Refactor pages into fragments. Load these list fragments into main activity.<br> 
Would elimnate having to define toolbars in each activity.
2) Use recycler view and a custom adapter, so that the recycler view <br>
can contain an image item, file item, and a note item
3) Implement resizeable image.
4) Many src files need abstraction to remove redundancy.
