# CMPS-121-Mobile-Applications
Container for CMPS 121 (mostly project) <br>
This project is not meant to be efficient. It is just a tool to learn some of the basics
of Android mobile development <br>
Be prepared for a lot of spagetti code if no one works on it after the final 
class submission <br>

## Things that could be done after final class submission
1) Refactor pages into fragments
2) Use recycler view and a custom adapter so that the recycler
can contain an image item and a note item
3)
